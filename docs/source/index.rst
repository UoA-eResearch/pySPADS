pySPADS documentation
=====================

**pySPADS** is an implementation of the "Shoreline Prediction at Different Time-Scales" (SPADS) algorithm developed in the paper `"A Multiscale Approach to Shoreline Prediction" by Montano et. al. (2020). <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020GL090587>`_

This documentation is a work in progress, and will be expanded as the project develops. Currently, the most useful reference for using pySPADS is the `example script hindcast.py <https://github.com/UoA-eResearch/pySPADS/blob/main/scripts/hindcast.py>`_.
